```

Then set `theme = "mana"` in your `hugo.toml` configuration file.

## Requirements

- Hugo Extended version 0.100.0 or higher (required for PostCSS support)

## Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `hugo.toml` file. You can also reference the `example.toml` file in the theme root for a complete example configuration.

### Basic Configuration

```toml
[params]
  description = "Your site description"
  favicon = "/favicon/favicon.ico"
  footerText = "Built with Hugo and Mana theme"  # Optional
  
  # Hero section title (optional - defaults to site.Title)
  heroTitleLine1 = "Your Site Name"  # First line of hero title
  heroTitleLine2 = "Your Tagline"    # Second line of hero title (optional)
```

### Avatar

Configure your avatar image (displayed on home page and about page):

```toml
[params.avatar]
  url = "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
```

### Social Links

Add your social media links:

```toml
[params.social]
  github = "https://github.com/yourusername"
  linkedin = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"
  email = "your.email@example.com"
```

### Buy Me a Coffee Widget

Enable the Buy Me a Coffee floating widget:

```toml
[params.buyMeACoffee]
  enabled = true
  id = "yourwidgetid"
  description = "Support me on Buy me a coffee!"
  message = ""  # Optional message
  color = "#BD5FFF"  # Widget color
  position = "Right"  # "Left" or "Right"
  x_margin = "18"  # Horizontal margin in pixels
  y_margin = "18"  # Vertical margin in pixels
```

### Menu Configuration

Configure your site navigation menu:

```toml
[[menus.main]]
  name = 'Home'
  pageRef = '/'
  weight = 10

[[menus.main]]
  name = 'Posts'
  pageRef = '/posts'
  weight = 20

[[menus.main]]
  name = 'Tags'
  pageRef = '/tags'
  weight = 30

[[menus.main]]
  name = 'About'
  url = '/about/'
  weight = 40
```

### Pagination

The theme includes pagination for the posts listing page (Sorted by date).
Configure the number of posts per page:

```toml
[pagination]
  pageSize = 10  # Number of posts per page (default: 10)
```

The pagination controls include:
- **First/Last page links** - Jump to the beginning or end
- **Previous/Next links** - Navigate sequentially
- **Page numbers** - Direct navigation to specific pages
- **Current page indicator** - Shows which page you're on
- **Page information** - Displays total posts and pages

Pagination automatically appears when you have more posts than the configured `pageSize`. The controls are designed

### Table of Contents

Enable table of contents for posts:

```toml
[markup]
  [markup.tableOfContents]
    startLevel = 1
    endLevel = 6
    ordered = false
```

### Blockquotes and Alerts

The theme includes support for styled blockquotes and GitHub/Obsidian-style alerts (admonitions). To enable this feature, add the following configuration:

```toml
[markup]
  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.parser]
      # Enable block-level attributes for blockquotes
      [markup.goldmark.parser.attribute]
        block = true
        title = true
```

#### Usage

**Regular blockquote:**
```markdown
> This is a regular blockquote with some text.
```

**Simple alert/admonition:**
```markdown
> [!TIP]
> This is a helpful tip for your readers.
```

**Collapsible alert with custom title:**
```markdown
> [!WARNING]+ Custom Warning Title
> This is a collapsible warning that can be expanded/collapsed.
```

#### Supported Alert Types

The theme supports the following alert types:
- `NOTE` / `INFO` - Informational content
- `TIP` - Helpful tips and suggestions
- `IMPORTANT` - Important information
- `WARNING` / `CAUTION` - Warnings and cautions
- `SUCCESS` - Success messages
- `QUESTION` - Questions or prompts
- `DANGER` - Critical warnings
- `BUG` - Bug reports or known issues
- `EXAMPLE` - Example content

#### Collapsible Alerts

Use `+` or `-` after the alert type to make it collapsible:
- `[!TIP]+` - Collapsed by default (click to expand)
- `[!TIP]-` - Expanded by default (click to collapse)

You can also add a custom title:
```markdown
> [!NOTE]+ My Custom Title
> This alert has a custom title instead of the default "Note".
```

The syntax is compatible with GitHub Flavored Markdown, Obsidian, and Typora.

### Code Syntax Highlighting

The theme supports theme-aware syntax highlighting using Chroma. By default, it uses Catppuccin themes:
- **Dark mode**: `catppuccin-macchiato`
- **Light mode**: `catppuccin-frappe`

Configure the themes in your `hugo.toml`:

```toml
[markup]
  [markup.highlight]
    codeFences = true
    guessSyntax = true
    noClasses = false
    style = "catppuccin-macchiato"  # Default style

[params]
  [params.codeHighlight]
    darkTheme = "catppuccin-macchiato"   # Theme for dark mode
    lightTheme = "catppuccin-frappe"     # Theme for light mode
```

#### Generating Syntax Highlighting CSS

To generate the CSS files for syntax highlighting, run these commands in your project root:

```bash
# Generate dark theme CSS
hugo gen chromastyles --style=catppuccin-macchiato > themes/mana/assets/css/syntax-dark.css

# Generate light theme CSS
hugo gen chromastyles --style=catppuccin-frappe > themes/mana/assets/css/syntax-light.css
```

**Note**: These CSS files are already included in the theme. You only need to regenerate them if you want to use different Chroma styles. You can use any valid Chroma style name (e.g., `github`, `monokai`, `dracula`, etc.).

### Search Index

Enable JSON output for search functionality:

```toml
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "JSON"]
```

### 404 Page Configuration

Customize the 404 error page message:

```toml
[params]
  # Custom message for the 404 error page (supports HTML)
  # If not set, defaults to: "Sorry, the page you are looking for could not be found."
  custom404Message = "Sorry, the page you are looking for could not be found. I guess I don't have a guide for <em>everything</em>"
```

The 404 page uses the same hero section styling as your home page, providing a consistent user experience.

### Umami Analytics

The theme supports Umami Analytics for privacy-friendly page tracking:

```toml
[params]
  [params.umami]
    # Set your Umami website ID for page tracking
    websiteId = "your-umami-website-id"
```

To use Umami:
1. Sign up for an account at [Umami Cloud](https://umami.is/) or self-host Umami
2. Create a website in your Umami dashboard
3. Copy your website ID and add it to your configuration

The Umami script will be automatically included in your site's `<head>` section.

## Post Frontmatter

The theme supports standard Hugo frontmatter. For post images, add an `image` parameter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-01-01
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
image: "/images/your-image.png"
---
```

## Pages

The theme includes layouts for:
- **Home page** - Displays mini about section and recent posts
- **Posts listing** - Shows all posts with filtering
- **Single post** - Individual post view with metadata and table of contents
- **Tags page** - Tag cloud view
- **Individual tag page** - Posts grouped by year for each tag
